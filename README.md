## General introduction

It's a "work in progress project" so maybe you gonna encounter some trubble and error, so don't hesitated to reported me any problem.
There is no restriction to use and distribute the "Series Plotter" files, as long as you refer this GitHub. 

*Excel version :*
  - should work on any version greeter than Excel 2016
  - never tested on version older than Excel 2016
  - some very specifiques utility may not work on the restrained version of Excel (as students version or application)

*Systems :*
  - Windows 10 (32bit) : not tested but should work
  - Windows 10 (64bi) : tested and work
  - Windows 11 (64bit) : not tested but should work
  - MacOS (Monterey) : tested and don't work
  
  For the MacOS user, Microsoft removed several developpement facilities from Mac Excel, so i'm not working on a proper version by now, sorry...
