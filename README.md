# Series-Plotter

This files work with VBA, so to use it you need allow the execution of macro after the first opening.

Is a work in progress project so maybe you gonna encounter some trubble and error, so don't hesitated to reported me any problem.
There is no restriction to use and distribute the "Series Plotter" files, as long as you mension me. 

Excel version :
  - should work on any version greeter than Excel 2016
  - never tested on version older than Excel 2016
  - some very specifiques utility may not work on the restrained version of Excel (as students version or application)

Systems :
  - Windows 10 (32bit) : not tested but should work
  - Windows 10 (64bi) : tested and work
